Hi ! Here is a modification of the basic css of esx_notify which makes various aesthetic modifications.

> Notification at top left
> 
> Color bar at the top instead of at the bottom
> 
> Spawn animation from the left
>
> Animated line to signal the end of the notification


**Installation is very simple** ! Delete the old **style.css** here: **esx_notify\nui\css** and replace it with the new one
